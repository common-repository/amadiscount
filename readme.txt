This is a plugin which creates tables of products which have significant Amazon Discounts and displays them on a Wordpress post or page. The table contains a description, an image and a discount. 


== Description ==

A great new Amazon Discount Finder Plugin for Wordpress - extremely powerful and so simple that anyone can use it to find Amazon discounted items and then create a discount table with your affiliate links automatically embedded. 

You’ve seen the various table making plugins, well ADF goes much further. It searches your selected Amazon categories for discounted items and then creates a table with the best discounts. Each one has your Amazon affiliate link embedded so anyone clicking on an item will visit Amazon and if they buy you get the commissions! You get commissions on 4 out of every 5 clicks, with the 5 coming to us to keep this plugin free forever and to pay for further development. 

The table automatically updates each day so you can be sure your customers are getting the best deals. 

* No coding knowledge required, simply install the plugin and it does the rest
* Works with WordPress 2.7 onwards
